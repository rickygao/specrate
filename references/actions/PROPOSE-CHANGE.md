# Action: Propose Change

When proposing a new change, follow these steps:

1. Ensure `specrate/changes/` exists; create it if missing.
2. Create a new folder `specrate/changes/{change-id}/` with a unique `change-id` that describes the change.
   - Propose a `change-id` based on the user's description if not provided, and confirm it with the user.
   - If the folder already exists, inform the user, suggest amending the existing change instead, and abort the current action.
3. Inside the new folder, create the following required files:
   - `state`: containing the text `PROPOSED` only.
   - `proposal.md`: using the [CHANGES-PROPOSAL.md](../../assets/templates/CHANGES-PROPOSAL.md) template.
   - `spec-delta.md`: using the [CHANGES-SPEC-DELTA.md](../../assets/templates/CHANGES-SPEC-DELTA.md) template.
4. Fill out the `proposal.md` and `spec-delta.md` files with the relevant information about the change.
5. Optionally, add any additional files related to the change, such as diagrams or supporting documents only if requested by the user.
6. Summarize the created change proposal and provide any next steps if applicable.
